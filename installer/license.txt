LICENSE ADDENDUM TO END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR AUTOMATIONSTUDIO SOFTWARE ACADEMIC LICENSE GUIDELINES 

This addendum only applies to Software that is Automation Studio simulation software.

The educating of new users and the research conducted with Automation Studio simulation software is invaluable to BTech.  This is one reason why BTech will continue to offer Automation Studio to academic users at a significant discount.  In order to enable us to continue to our academic program, we take our end user license agreement (EULA) very seriously and expect our users to abide by the established academic use of the software for strictly educational and research purposes.  This document is meant to provide guidelines for using Automation Studio's Academic Licensing.

DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC

An academic license may be purchased by any accredited institution where the main focus is on educating students and/or providing research.  Many commercial organizations also have an academic component that offers training or teaching, such as service companies and hospitals. The organization's focus cannot be on supporting external systems, such as non-profit / for-profit hospitals, technology institutes, or think tanks. Unless education is the primary service delivered by the institution, it will be considered to be commercial unless prior written authorization from BTech is obtained.

ACADEMIC USERS

Use of the license seats are bound to the college/department that has purchased the seats (for example, if the engineering department purchased the seats, the software can be used only by that college, not shared with the business college).  Only currently enrolled and/or registered students and currently employed professors and staff within the purchasing college/department are authorized to use Automation Studio academic software.  This includes currently enrolled and/or registered students who are currently enrolled in a course in the license-owning college or in a multidisciplinary course included in the license-owning college.  Upon request by BTech, You agree to provide proof of such enrollment and/or employment.

COMMERCIAL USE

Use of the academic-licensed software for commercial use is a violation of the end user license agreement (EULA).  The use of the Automation Studio academic licensed software is not permitted for commercial, professional, commercial training, or other for-profit purposes.  While it is common for sponsoring corporations to provide funding for projects, that funding should be in the form of a grant to the academic institution and not to the individual groups, professors/advisors guiding the research or student project work, or other affiliated groups established by or employing the professors/advisors within the institution. This includes instances where the academic user has an ongoing relationship (other research projects) with the corporate sponsor.  Money transfer can also be characterized where an internal "cost equalization" takes place between departments or organizations.  Use of the academic license for commercial purposes could result in revocation of the academic-licensed software.

DISTRIBUTION OF MODEL, TEMPLATES, AND MODEL DATA

The distribution of the model (.xml, .jar), module file (.com) for a study is prohibited without approval by BTech.  Data and visuals (including displaying animations that use file types like .avi, .wav, etc.) may be presented as part of analysis that is publicly shared (e.g., contained within a published thesis or paper).  If the commercial institution and/or organization outside of the license-holding college participating in the research or study request the model and/or templates for the study, please contact the BTech sales representative for assistance on how to transfer the model legally.

RESEARCH

BTech encourages the use of Automation Studio software for conducting independent academic research.  The Automation Studio academic version can be used for not-for-profit research outside of the classroom setting, where the primary goal of the research is to solve a general problem with the results being publicly shared and published.  Research outside of these bounds including for-profit and/or outside of the classroom setting where the research is conducted to solve a specific problem for an organization (both internal and external) is not permissible use of the Automation Studio academic software.  For clarification and/or should research be outside of academic use research guidelines, please contact your  sales representative for information on the appropriate university research licensing.

UNDERGRADUATE SENIOR PROJECTS AND GRADUATE WORK 

BTech encourages the use of Automation Studio for senior and other classroom-related projects.  These projects include undergraduate, graduate and doctorate theses.  This experience enables students to use simulation to solve real-world problems and exposes recipient companies to the benefits derived from the use of simulation.  These efforts must be undertaken as not-for-profit to comply with academic-use guidelines.  Distribution of model(jar) and/or modules(com) must also adhere to the aforementioned guidelines. 

CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION AND INTERNSHIP ASSIGNMENTS

BTech encourages the use of Automation Studio in students' cooperative education and internship assignments.  This experience provides a valuable learning tool in utilizing simulation in solving real-world problems.  However, the use of academic licensing for these assignments is forbidden.  It is the responsibility of the company (including adjoining institutes, hospitals, technology institutes, etc.) sponsoring the assignment to obtain the appropriate commercial licensing.  The use of the evaluation version is permitted.
